We are conducting a four step method to optimizing a stock portfolio


For the third step (correlation analysis) of our four step method we use the model developed by Hyeong Kyu Choi, for the research visit: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01560v5.pdf
The code for our third step of correlation analysis is from: https://github.com/imhgchoi/ARIMA-LSTM-hybrid-corrcoef-predict

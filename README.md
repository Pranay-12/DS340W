We are conducting a four step machine learning based approach to optimizing a stock portfolio

First Step: Stock Index Selection

Second Step: Stock Selection

Third Step: Correlation Analysis

Fourth Step: Visualization of Correlation Analysis


For the third step (correlation analysis) of our four step method we use the model developed by Hyeong Kyu Choi, for the research visit: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01560v5.pdf

The code for our third step of correlation analysis is from: https://github.com/imhgchoi/ARIMA-LSTM-hybrid-corrcoef-predict 
We made some modifications it.
